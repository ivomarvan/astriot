                            <p>Developing assistive technologies is <b>costly</b> because each individual with a

                                has <b>unique needs</b>.</p>
                            <p>For example, in cases of lock-in syndrome (where a patient cannot communicate directly),
                                personalized movement options, such as using the mouth, hands, and similar methods,
                                can be identified.
                                Additionally, the application has other specific requirements, including range of motion
                                capabilities,
                                uncontrolled movements (tics), and more.
                            </p>
                            <p>Also, hardware components such as a camera and a sufficiently powerful computer for image
                                processing do not have to be cheap.</p>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>

                        For <b>hardware</b>, we will use devices that <b>users already own</b> or can obtain affordably.

                                    processing, as well as its camera and/or microphone. It could also potentially
