                    <p>A <b>concept and set of libraries</b> for affordable image processing to <b>extract facial and

                            <p>Developing assistive technologies is <b>costly</b> because each individual with a

                                has <b>unique needs</b>.</p>
                            <p>For example, in cases of lock-in syndrome (where a patient cannot communicate directly),
                                personalized movement options, such as using the mouth, hands, and similar methods,
                                can be identified.
                                Additionally, the application has other specific requirements, including range of motion
                                capabilities,
                                uncontrolled movements (tics), and more.
                            </p>
                            <p>Also, hardware components such as a camera and a sufficiently powerful computer for image
                                processing do not have to be cheap.</p>

                    <h2>Project status</h2>
                    <p>The project is in the early stages of development.
                        We plan to do the following steps</p>

                    <h3>Supported programming languages</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>JavaScript</b> - for web applications,</li>
                        <li><b>C++ Arduino like</b> - for embedded devices (with microprocessor)</li>
                        <li><b>Python</b></li>
                        - for a wide range of (desktop) applications
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Communication API</h3>
                    <p>We want to design an <b>API</b> that will define the format of the transmitted <b>data</b>
                        and <b>commands</b> for
                        communication between the "transmitter" (smartphone) and the "receiver" (application). An
                        <b>abstract description format</b> will be used to generate the appropriate libraries in the
                        above
                        programming languages.</p>

                    <h3>Communication canals</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the programming languages mentioned above, we also want to implement parts of the <b>libraries</b>
                        to support communication between "transmitter" and "receiver" for the following connection
                        methods:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>WebRTC</b> (PeerJs) for web applications. All modern browsers support the technology.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Bluetooth</b> for embedded devices. (We will use the <b>Bluetooth Low Energy</b> (BLE)
                            technology.)
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Socket</b> for communication with the server
                            (via public WiFi, or in case the application creates a WiFi hotspot)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>AstriotTx - Mobile application (transmitter)</a></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is a common application that <b>solves all common problems with image processing</b>
                            (generally sensor data processing).
                        </li>
                        <li>This data broadcasting application is designed as a simple <b>html page</b> that you can
                            open
                            on your mobile. <b>No installation required.</b> Use the link or QR code to open
                            the page on your mobile phone.
                        </li>
                        <li>Further instructions will already depend on the "data receiver"
                            application, most often it will be about selecting a camera (if there are more)
                            and setting it to the observed object. Usually on yourself.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Sample applications (receivers)</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li><h3><b>RxComplexWeb</b> - Test user web application</h3>
                            In your web browser, you can see what processed data your mobile phone sends
                            from the main application.
                            You can open it in any browser - for example on your desktop.
                        </li>
                        <li><h3><b>RxBulb</b> - Turn lights on and off using gestures</h3>
                            A simple, cheap hardware application where we will show you how to easily make a piece
                            of hardware that use visual date from your mobile phone. You can turn the light on and
                            off by opening and closing your palm. We'll use a few trivial components worth about $9 in
                            total.
                            <br>
                            We will also show how to modify this application so that you can control the light by
                            blinking.
                        </li>
                        <li><h3><b>RxLedDisplay</b> - Complex application with LED display</h3>
                            We will demonstrate different types of use of text data from mobile using a 16x16 RGB
                            LED matrix. We receive and process the data using a cheap ESP32 chip.
                        </li>
                        <li><h3><b>RxMouseButtons</b> - PowerPoint presentation control with hand gestures</h3>
                            We will demonstrate the modification of a wireless computer mouse so that its right
                            and left buttons will be controlled by gestures. When connected to any computer,
                            we can effectively move the individual slides of the presentation with the power of
                            gestures.
                        </li>
                        <li><h3>... your own application</h3></li>
                    </ul>
