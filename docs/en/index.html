                        which provide <b>textual outputs via an API</b> for extensive use in assistive technologies and other applications.

                            <p>Developing assistive technologies is <b>expensive</b> because each individual with a disability has <b>unique needs</b>.
                            </p>
                            <p>For example, in patients with locked-in syndrome (who cannot communicate directly), personalized movement options such as using the mouth, hands, or similar methods can be identified. Applications must also consider specific requirements, including limitations in movement range, involuntary movements (tics), and other factors.</p>
                            <p>Also, specialized hardware for image processing may not be inexpensive.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>Let’s break down the many specialized tasks into their <b>common components</b> and <b>remaining parts</b>. For <b>hardware</b>, we will use devices that <b>users already own</b> or can acquire affordably.</p>

                                <li>We will use <b>unified software</b> to capture data on facial and body positions, gestures, sounds, etc.</li>
                                <li>This software will run <b>on a smartphone</b>, thus utilizing its processor for image and sound processing, as well as its camera and/or microphone. Additional sensors like GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, light sensors, etc., can potentially be used.</li>
                                <li>We will define an <b>API</b> (Application Programming Interface) that other developers can use to create their applications. The API will provide a <b>stream of textual data</b>.</li>
                                <li>We will present <b>several demo applications</b> to demonstrate the full concept of using API data.</li>

                            <p>The aim of the project is to publish the entire API (i.e. a detailed description of the data format) – ready for user applications. <b>Anyone can verify what information is being transmitted</b>.

                    <h2>Is a smartphone enough?</h2>
                    <div class="row">

                            <p>A smartphone is a <b>very powerful</b> computer that contains all the necessary components for image and sound processing. It also has <b>sensors</b> such as GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, light sensors, etc.</p>

                            <p>A smartphone is <b>affordable</b> and <b>versatile</b>. Most people already own one and use it for many purposes. Therefore, there is no need to purchase additional specialized hardware.</p>
                            <p>It is reasonable to expect that <b>both cameras and processors</b> (with AI support) will continue to <b>improve</b>.</p>
                            <p><b>If</b> for some application a smartphone <b>proves insufficient</b>, it is possible to use it to <b>fine-tune</b> the application and then <b>migrate it to specialized hardware</b>.
                                As long as this hardware (with any camera) supports modern web technologies, <b>everything will work without modifications</b>.
                            </p>
                            <p>Similarly to a smartphone, a laptop or desktop computer with a camera can also serve this purpose.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Project Status</h2>
                    <p>The project is in its early development stages. We plan the following steps</p>

                    <h3>Supported Programming Languages</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>JavaScript</b> - for web applications</li>
                        <li><b>C++ Arduino</b> - for embedded devices (with microprocessors)</li>
                        <li><b>Python</b> - for a wide range of (desktop) applications</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Communication API</h3>
                    <p>We intend to design an <b>API</b> that defines the format of transmitted <b>data</b> and <b>commands</b> for communication between the “transmitter” (smartphone) and the “receiver” (application). An <b>abstract description format</b> will be used to generate the corresponding libraries in the aforementioned programming languages.</p>

                    <h3>Communication Channels</h3>
                    <p>In the above programming languages, we also plan to implement parts of <b>libraries</b> to support communication between the “transmitter” and the “receiver” for the following connection methods:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>WebRTC</b> (PeerJs) for web applications. All modern browsers support this technology.</li>
                        <li><b>Bluetooth</b> for embedded devices. (We will use <b>Bluetooth Low Energy</b> (BLE).)</li>
                        <li><b>Socket</b> for communication with a server (via public WiFi or a WiFi hotspot application).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Application Examples - Demos</h2>
                    <p>To demonstrate the concept and libraries, we have prepared several demo applications. <a
